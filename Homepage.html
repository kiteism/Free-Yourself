    <p>I always thought I saw him just around the corner or walking up ahead of me on a crowded street – and I had chased down several unsuspecting strangers, each time positive it was him. <br><br> It was always like that with us. The timing was wrong.<br><br>      This time, it was him who was unavailable, but that didn’t change the fact that I wanted him. <br><br>But, like every other time, he got just close enough to make me long for him. Even worse, it took less and less contact each time. It seemed that
      these days, all I needed was a simple “Hello” and I had already run away with him in my mind.<br><br> One thing I could count on in my life was that he would show up at exactly the wrong moment.<br><br> And, each time, he pulled away – and he always
      pulled away – the hurt was fresh and new, yet oddly comforting in its familiarity. <br><br>He would never be mine. I would never be his. Yet, somehow, we belonged to one another.</p>
